# IntelliSwarm: An Adaptive Multi-Agent Framework for Scalable NLP Tasks

## Overview

IntelliSwarm implements a scalable and adaptive multi-agent architecture to perform diverse NLP tasks including summarization, keyword extraction, redundancy analysis, grammar checking, coverage scoring, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text classification, and question answering.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Multiple specialized agents collaborate via a thread-safe blackboard, enhancing collective intelligence
- **Dynamic Trust and Affinity System:** Agents possess task affinities with dynamic trust scores that evolve based on performance metrics
- **Flexible Scaling:** User-configurable number of agents (1-20) offering balance between depth of analysis and computational cost
- **Comprehensive Task Support:** Unified implementation covering 10 distinct NLP tasks
- **Thread-Safe Blackboard Architecture:** Ensures safe concurrent information sharing
- **Intelligent Performance Metrics:** Tracks per-agent efficacy with adaptive trust adjustments
- **Realistic Concurrency Model:** Utilizes Python's ThreadPoolExecutor to leverage concurrency for IO and mixed workloads

## Execution Model

### Sequential Processing with Concurrent Potential
- Agents process tasks sequentially in rounds, posting results to the shared blackboard
- **Concurrency Implementation:** Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for thread-based concurrency
- **GIL Awareness:** True CPU parallelism limited by Python's Global Interpreter Lock
- **Practical Benefits:** Concurrency improves throughput for IO-bound NLP tasks
- **Adaptive Refinement:** Multiple rounds enable trust-based performance optimization

### Agent Coordination
1. **Round-Based Execution:** Agents run in structured rounds for iterative improvement
2. **Blackboard Communication:** Thread-safe shared memory for result aggregation
3. **Trust Calibration:** Dynamic adjustment of agent reliability scores
4. **Task Affinity Matching:** Agents specialized for specific NLP tasks
