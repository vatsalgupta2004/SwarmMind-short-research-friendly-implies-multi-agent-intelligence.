SwarmMind: Multi-Agent NLP Framework
SwarmMind is an advanced, interactive swarm intelligence framework for natural language processing (NLP). It orchestrates a collection of specialized AI agents over a shared blackboard, enabling robust multi-perspective analysis, summarization, extraction, and advanced text understanding in a scalable, transparent, and efficient way.

Features

Multi-agent architecture: Modular agents for independent and cooperative NLP analysis

Thread-safe blackboard: Agents communicate by publishing/extracting knowledge to a common workspace

Dynamic scaling: Flexible number of agents for adjustable thoroughness/performance

Weighted consensus: Trust-based aggregation and adaptive agent weighting

Interactive CLI: Guided user interface for all core and advanced NLP tasks

Performance metrics: Objective measurements for coverage, redundancy, and text quality

Zero non-stdlib dependencies: Runs everywhere Python 3 is available

Demo
To see SwarmMind in action on all supported NLP tasks:

bash
python3 enhanced_swarmmind_framework.py
# Choose "2. Demo Mode (all tasks)" at the prompt, or run interactively for custom input
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swarmmind.git
cd swarmmind
Run with Python 3.8+ (no extra packages required):

bash
python3 enhanced_swarmmind_framework.py
Usage

After launching, use the interactive menu to:

Select your NLP task (summarization, keyword extraction, entity recognition, etc.)
Configure the number of AI agents for your desired level of thoroughness
Paste or enter your input text
Receive a detailed analysis, including interpretation, metrics, and agent consensus

Supported Tasks

SwarmMind supports both classic and advanced text analytics, out-of-the-box:

Summarization: Extract the most important sentences from a text
Keyword Extraction: Identify key terms and concepts
Redundancy Analysis: Detect repetitive or duplicate content
Grammar & Fluency Check: Assess clarity and grammatical quality
Coverage & Importance Scoring: Measure topic coverage and sentence importance
Named Entity Recognition: Identify people, places, organizations, and dates
Sentiment & Emotion Analysis: Understand positive/negative tone and emotion
Topic Modeling & Theme Detection: Discover latent topics and recurring themes
Text Classification: Categorize documents by type or domain
Question Answering: Extract likely answers to questions and key facts

Architecture

Blackboard system: Shared knowledge repository for agent communication
Agents: Task-specialized, thread-safe analyzers (NLP, ML, heuristics)
Consensus engine: Aggregates agent outputs by trust, confidence, and performance
Swarm controller: Orchestrates agent configuration, task assignment, and adaptive learning

Customization

Modular design: Add, modify, or disable agents for custom pipelines
Trust can be tuned per agent; consensus strategies are easy to extend
All results and metrics are accessible programmatically via the SwarmController object
