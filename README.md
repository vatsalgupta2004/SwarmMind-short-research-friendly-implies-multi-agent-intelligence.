# Initialize swarm
swarm = EnhancedSwarmController()
text = "Your text here..."

# Configure for sentiment analysis
swarm.configure_for_task(TaskType.SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS, num_agents=8)

# Execute parallel processing
metrics = swarm.run_task_processing_parallel(text, rounds=2)

# Get results
results = swarm.get_task_results()
print(f"Sentiment: {results['sentiment']}")
print(f"Confidence: {results['confidence']:.2f}")
